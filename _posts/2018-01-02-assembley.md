Binary is completely unusable but Assembley Language is usable and very close to binary.

Each line of assembley code is one operation.

Operation codes are called mneomics.

Registers have names that indiviudally identify them.

Addresses are specified using labels.

Example:
```
Adjust: mov eax num1 ; get first number
```
adjust is the label
mov is the opcode
eax is the register
num1 is a label
anything after ";" is a comment.

This can be translated to binary usign an assembler. _asm
