# What is Object Oritentated Programming?
OOP is a programming paradigm (much like functional programming) where everything is considered an object. As an example a person can be considered an object. Objects can have _attributes_ such as a person's first name, last name, or their date of birth.

Objects can be shown graphically using tables like so

Person |
| --- |
| Firstname: String | 
| Lastname: String |
| Date of birth: String |
| new Person (Firstname: "Brandon", Lastname: "Skerritt", Date of birth: "3rd of May 1997")|

In this table we can see that an object exists called Person and it has 3 attributes, first name, last name, or their date of birth.
We write how to call this object at the bottom of the table.

Each class can have methods (functions) which allow them to calculate the attributes they have.

## Data Encapsulation

Object's data cannot be accessed directly or modified directly. If you want to get person's first name, you need to ask it for it. In this case

```
Brandon = New Person(Firstname: "Brandon", Lastname: "Skerritt", Date of birth: "3rd of May 1997")
Brandon.Firstname = "Brandon"
Brandon.Lastname = "Skerritt"
```

## Inheritance

Objects can inherit from other objects. If you have an employee object, all employees are people, so therefore employees can inherit from people.

Person |
| --- |
| Firstname: String | 
| Lastname: String |
| Date of birth: String |
| new Person (Firstname: "Brandon", Lastname: "Skerritt", Date of birth: "3rd of May 1997")|

^
|

Employee |
| --- | 
| Employee ID: Number | 

In this diagram, Employee inherits Firstname, Lastname and Date of birth from the Person object.
