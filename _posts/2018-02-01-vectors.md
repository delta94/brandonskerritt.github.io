I highly reccomend you watch this video before working with Vectors

# What is a vector?
A vector is a container where order matters and repitiions are allowed.
An N vector has n components, each component called <br>
$$U\_1, U\_2, ... , U\_n$$ <br>
Different values in a vector can be the same, so: <br>
$$<1, 1>$$ <br>
is entirely possible with Vectors.

A 2-vector represents 2 dimensional space and a 3-vector represents 3-dimensional space.

# Doing maths with vectors

Two vectors can be added like so:

$$ \vec{A} + \vec{B} = \vec{W} = <A\_1 + B\_1, A\_2 + B\_2, ... , A\_n + B\_n>$$

The resultant is a new vector, $\vec{W}$.

Scalar multiplcation is where you increase every item in a vector by R.
Let R be a real number then:

$$ R * \vec{A} = \vec{W} = <A\_1 * R, A\_2 * R, ... , A\_n * R>$$

Vector length can be defined using cardinality. The length of a vector, A, is |A|. 
The length of a vector has uses this formula:

$$ |\vec{a}| = \sqrt{(\{a\_1  ^2} + \{a\_2  ^2} + ... + \{a_n  ^2})} $$

$$ {a_1 ^2} $$

$$ a_1 ^2 $$
