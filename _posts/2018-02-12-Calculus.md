# Functions
We've all seen what a function looks like. Any function can be plotted onto a graph as a line.

# Function of a line
To work out the function of a line you need to find out how steep the line is, y, and find out what poitn should be on the line when x = 0, c.

This gives us the formula:

$$ y = mx + c $$

## Gradience

We can find the gradient using this formula:

$$ \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

Or in other words

How much Y should change relative to how much X has changed.

## Finding the offset

So we already know some facts:

<0, c> is on the line but we don't know where
$$ <x_1, y_1,> $$ is on the line

We know line has gradient M

We know this gradient does not change, as it is a line.

So the gradient from <0, c> to <x1, y1> is the same as the gradient from <x1, y1> to <x2, y2>

In other words, C must be (when x = 0)

$$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{y_1 - c}{x_1 - 0} $$

# Weird looking graphs

Let's say you have a graph that looks like this:

How do you calculate the line function of that graph?

We start with some function, we'll call it F(x)

We choose to places, x = a and x = b and find the values of F(a) and F(b)

Then we use the line connecting <a, F(a)> to <b, F(b)> to "reason about" F(x). 

If we use this method we can approximate lines like so:

Well, that's a bit rubbish isn't it?
