# Origins

We know that there are roots for every polynomial however there are 'problem polynomials' such as:

$$ x^2 + 1 $$

$$ x^2 - 2x + 2 $$

$$ x^3 - 8 $$

There are problemmatic because they do not have **real-valued** roots. For the first two cases there are _no_ real roots at all.

The idea of complex numbers is to find a way to treat problem polynomials in an unproblematic way.

In the 17th and 18th century this was a big problem for mathematicians.

Polynomials should have 2 solutions and they are where the graph crosses the x-axis. But what are the roots of a polynomial like this?

Decartes' calls the roots "imaginery" in his book La Geometrie

    “For the rest, neither the false nor the true roots are always real, sometimes they are only imaginary, that is to say one may imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity corresponding to those one imagines.”

    — Rene Descartes

We know that $$x^2 + 1$$ has two roots so let's invent a name for these, $$\mathbb{i}$$ with  $$\mathbb{i}^2 = (-\mathbb{i})^2 = -1$$ then $$x=\mathbb{i}$$ and $$x=-\mathbb{i}$$ are the two roots.

# The Formal Definition of the set of complex numbers

The complex numbers are a set described by the symbol $$\mathbb{C}$$.

Given X and Y $$\in \mathbb{R}$$

The *imaginary* or *complex* number Z is $$x + \mathbb{i}y$$ where $$\mathbb{i} = \sqrt{-1}$$ $$z = x + \mathbb{i}y$$ has a _real_ part denoted
