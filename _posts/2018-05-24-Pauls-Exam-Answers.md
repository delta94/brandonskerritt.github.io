# Question 1

What type of number is used to count the number of individuals living at a specified address?

## Answer

Natural numbers. The question here says individualS. Implying there is more than 1 person. So we start counting at 1. Natural numbers allow us to count from 1.

If it were possible for 0 people to live at the address then it would be whole numbers.

# Question 2

What type of number is used to count the number of children (defined as anyone under 16) living at an address?

## Answer

Whole numbers. Since it's possible no children live at an address.

## Question 3

A company pays its employees using a basic unit of £X per month and a salary scale in which Senior
Management receive £X^2 per month; Trainee managers are paid £X and all other workers earn a fixed
amount of £500 per month. If the company employs 250 Senior Managers, 100 Trainee Managers and
5 others, which of the polynomials describes its monthly salary costs?

### Answer

$$ 250x^2 + 100x + 5 * 500 = 250x^2 + 100x + 2500 $$

Simple maths. The equation for a polynomial like this is:

$$ x^2 + x + y $$

## Question 4

The same company decides to appoint a single Senior Executive Vice-President who will be given
X^3 per month, and at the same time it reduces its (non-managerial) workforce to a single person who
now receive £600 per month. Which of the polynomials below describes its annual salary costs?

$$ £x^3 + £250x^2 + £100x + £600 $$
### Answer

It's important to know that this is the **annual** cost. The previous monthly costs now must be multipled by 12.

$$ £12x^3 + 12 * 250x^2 + 12 * 100x + 12 * 600 $$

$$ £12x^3 + 3000x^2 + 1200x + 7200 $$

Paul's questions are worded so weirdly so make sure to double read any question before attempting it.

## Question 5

What is the coefficient of $$x^0$$ in this formula?

$$f(x) = (x - 4)( x - 5)(x - 6)$$

### Answer

So $$x^0$$ is the same as saying "what is the number that is all on its own,  with no x value?".

Any number multiplied by $$x^0$$ is just the number.

$$ 12x^0 = 12$$.

So this is asking us "what is the number we get when we multiply out all the brackets?"

Since we specifically know we only want the singular number, we can ignore all x values and just multiply these together:

$$ -4 * -5 * -6 = -120$$

If you forget about this, you can just multiply out all the brackets.

Here's a good BBC article on it.

## Question 6

A robot crawler must move from its current position (recorded as a 2-dimensional coordinate) to a
location that is exactly 37 metres to its right. If the robot’s current location is < x, y > which of the
following describe its desired location?

### Answer

"to the right" means it's on the x axis. Because it's positive (+37) we know it's going to increase the x axis.

$$ <x + 37, y>

## Question 7

A region of pixels whose colours are described using the RGB-system in which each pixel, p, has its
colour defined by a 3-vector < pR, pG, pB > is manipulated over a period of ninety seconds by the
algorithm described below in which the variable T ime counts in milliseconds.

T ime := 0
while T ime ≤ 90000 do
if (T ime is an exact multiple of 30000)

$$ \begin{pmatrix}PR\\\PG\\\PB\end{pmatrix} := \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0 & 1\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\1 & 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}PR\\\PG\\\PB\end{pmatrix}}$$

end if
T ime := T ime + 1;
end while

Suppose this algorithm is applied to the pixels in a 600 × 600 square in which the colour c(p) of the
pixel at position < px, py > is initially
