## Podcasts

In line with my new years goal of listening to more podcasts, here are the podcasts I've listened to this month.

### Listen Money Matters

I've been a big fan of Thomas Frank's YouTube channel for a while now. This podcast is all about personal finance. 

The investing episode is really good as a starter to investing, although this podcast is mainly American advice it's good advice nevertheless.

### The Tim Ferris Show
Listen to this every day on my run üòÅ

### 99% invisible
Amazing 10/10 would reccomend best podcast every year forever

Really good podcast with a good introduction to making passive income!

Amazing show for my daily run!

### Prime ministers questions

# books

## How to win friends and influence people
I haven't finished this yet! I'm about 3 chapters from finishing. This is my 4th re-read of this book. By far, this book has had the most influence on my life. As someone with autism i hate all the non-rules of a normal human life. This book gives me clear rules on how to be sociable, its AMAZING!!

## Fluent Python

Python is such an amazing language! I've been a Python coder for 10 !!!! years this year!!! wowwww!!! This book is taking me from mediocre to advance python user. I love seeing all the quirks and cool things you can do in Python. Like uh hello Tuple Unpacking?? How is this feature real???

## I will teach you to be rich

A really good book. It's written in American, so skip all the 401k stuff. I think the only useful things to UK people are the budgetting, investing & maybe credit cards? Everything else is pretty useless. 

Thanks to this book, I moved my entire investments over to Vanguard Life stratergy 80.

## Tim Hale's Smarter Investing

Really really good book on investing in the UK!!! If you want to learn to invest, this is the book you need!!! I loved how the author has actually been there and done it, not just some academic too!

## The art of happiness

Not finished yet, but I'm looking at increasing my happiness. I suffer from depression, and I've always liked buddism. I'm currently on chapter 3, so should be a good read!!

## Mediations - aurcilus Antonin

Not finished yet, but so far it seems really good :)

## Thinking fast and slow

Not finished yet, not currently enjoying this book. Might give it up since it's so big and boring (so far)

## How to write your first book

This book answered SO MUCH of my questions!! I can't wait to publish my first book!!

### Networth

¬£185.32 in investments, ¬£759 in bank accounts. As it stands, 11% of my networth is in crypto and 8% in LS 80. 80% in cash! Goal by the end of the year: get 40% of my networth in investments! Diversify more too. I'm looking at P2P lending currently!

I have around ¬£200 set aside for my book, ¬£200 set aside for a holiday and ¬£300 waiting to be invested next month.

goals for next month:
* look at peer to peer lending
