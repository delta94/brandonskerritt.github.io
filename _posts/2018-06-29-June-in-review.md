## Podcasts

In line with my new years goal of listening to more podcasts, here are the podcasts I've listened to this month.

### Listen Money Matters

I've been a big fan of Thomas Frank's YouTube channel for a while now. This podcast is all about personal finance. 

The investing episode is really good as a starter to investing, although this podcast is mainly American advice it's good advice nevertheless.

### The Tim Ferris Show
Listen to this every day on my run 😁

# books

## How to win friends and influence people
I haven't finished this yet! I'm about 3 chapters from finishing. This is my 4th re-read of this book. By far, this book has had the most influence on my life. As someone with autism i hate all the non-rules of a normal human life. This book gives me clear rules on how to be sociable, its AMAZING!!

## Fluent Python

Python is such an amazing language! I've been a Python coder for 10 !!!! years this year!!! wowwww!!! This book is taking me from mediocre to advance python user. I love seeing all the quirks and cool things you can do in Python. Like uh hello Tuple Unpacking?? How is this feature real???

## I will teach you to be rich

A really good book. It's written in American, so skip all the 401k stuff. I think the only useful things to UK people are the budgetting, investing & maybe credit cards? Everything else is pretty useless. 

Thanks to this book, I moved my entire investments over to Vanguard Life stratergy 80.

## Tim Hale's Smarter Investing

Really really good book on investing in the UK!!! If you want to learn to invest, this is the book you need!!! I loved how the author has actually been there and done it, not just some academic too!

## The art of happiness

Not finished yet, but I'm looking at increasing my happiness. I suffer from depression, and I've always liked buddism. I'm currently on chapter 3, so should be a good read!!

## Mediations - aurcilus Antonin

Not finished yet, but so far it seems really good :)

## Thinking fast and slow

Not finished yet, not currently enjoying this book. Might give it up since it's so big and boring (so far)

## How to write your first book

This book answered SO MUCH of my questions!! I can't wait to publish my first book!!

# Finances

## Passive income

### Medium.com

### Investing

£83 invested in LS 80, £103 invested into crypto. I'm looking at other options like P2P lending too.

### Networth

£185.32 in investments, £759 in bank accounts. As it stands, 11% of my networth is in crypto and 8% in LS 80. 80% in cash! Goal by the end of the year: get 40% of my networth in investments! Diversify more too. I'm looking at P2P lending currently!

I have around £200 set aside for my book, £200 set aside for a holiday and £300 waiting to be invested next month.

# Fitness

## Average run length
maybe 2k?

## Sleeping

My average sleep is around about 7 - 8 hours, suepr healthy!!

Interview questions, loved by some, hated by many. These are often seen as the hardest part of the interview. What do you say? What do you do? What's the "right" answer here?

Interview questions make up 95% of an interview. The whole purpose of an interview is to ask questions and be asked questions. Luckily for you and I, according to Reed, there are only 15 interview questions. All other interview questions stem from these magic 15. 

We only need to know how to answer 20% of the interview questions to answer 80% of all the questions asked of you. The other 20%, well, that should come from your research on the company. Later on in this book, we will discuss how to research a company.

Let's get right into these interview questions.

    Tell me about yourself

Don't make the mistake of thinking this is about your personal life. They do not care about your personal life. It doesn't matter whether you have a dog or a cat. They want to hear your professional life story. 

Make sure to tell a story. Like previously discussed, humans are naturally prone to enjoying stories. Stories make the other person interested. Don't give out a bullet pointed list, talk with them.

This question is a combination of things. How well the candiate has prepared, their confidence, and what they've done in their professional life.

Even if you haven't done something interesting in your professional life, you can spin any story to make it sound amazing. In the world of news, bad stories are often spun into a good light. You can spin something non-interesting into interesting. Let's see an example of this.

Liverpool HackSoc is a new society at the University of Liverpool designed to allow anyone to learn to program. If you are a graphic designer for this society, that sounds okay. But if you say:

"I had the marvelous opportunity to work with Liverpool Hacksoc early on in my carer. We created Liverpool's hacker community akin to Manchester or Sheffield. We taught thousands of people to code, we got many people jobs. My role as graphic designer was to  elucidate  the society and entice people who were probaly never going to learn to program into learning to program."

Anything can be spun to sound amazing. It's all about selling yourself.  Let's use another example.

Let's say you work part-time at McDonalds. I chose this because this is the most mediocre thing I could think of. While working at McDonalds, you discovered that it's faster to type in the order as the person says it rather than to type it at the end. This isn't groundbreaking stuff, just a simple observation. We're going to spin this story to make you sound mind-blowingly amazing.

    In my teenage years I worked at a rapid quickfire fastfood chain. On average, we served around 400 customers an hour and during our peaks the store would get so busy the line would go out the door. In this environment, I learnt that I thrive under extreme amounts of pressue. Not only did I have to make sure that every single customer was over-joyus with their meals but I had to do it fast.


    Whilest working here, I created a new system that increased the speed and accuracy of processing information into an End Point of Sales system. This new system allowed us to serve twice as many customers per minute all whilest keeping the customer satisfaction levels high.


    One time, my store ran out of milk. My manager chose me to partake on this critical mission. To refill our stock supplies and refill them fast. Not only did I achieve this mission within 5 minutes, but I managed to achieve it before any customers requested items containing milk. Considering this restaurent serves 10 people a minute, I'll say that's some achievement. 

The point I'm trying to make here is that no matter how mediocre of a job you think you had, you can always spin it to make you sound amazing.

Okay, back to the question at hand. Businesses have elevator pitches. These are 30 second speeches that describe the business. The idea is if you are in an elevator with an investor, you have around 30 seconds to convince them to invest in the company. People can have elevator pitches too, and this is used to answer this question.

Your elevator pitcher should be customised per job position. Hopefully you'll understand that nearly everything should be customised per job position. I can't tell you what to say, as I don't know you. 

Don't make it sound like someone has never asked this question to you before. Act confident. Practice on your friends or in your mirror. Don't "uhmm" or "ehh" before answering. This makes you look like you haven't prepared, that you're not confident. Look them in the eye, smile, and say it out loud like you've rehearsed it every day of your life. 

Always start your pitch with what you currently do (professionally). End that paragraph with something that leads the interviewer back in time. You want to tell a story. You also want to talk about your most recent things first.

    I'm a computer science student at the University of Liverpool. I'm aiming to get a first class degree. Previously I was studying a level 4 diploma at a local college



The next part leads back into your past. Notice how I ended the first part with "Previous I was". This gently pushes you and the reader back into the past. I'm a student, and the likely chance is that you are a student. Education is the thing that defines us, but if you have any part time jobs working in industry you can put them here. 

If you are a software engineer, you can say something like this:
 

    I'm a computer science student at the University of Liverpool. I'm aiming to get a first class degree. I'm also a software engineer part-time.

Make sure each section smoothly leads into the other.

The second section should talk about your achievements. Don't talk about your responsibillities, what you had to do. Talk about what you have achieved. 

In my case, it'll look like this:

    While at college I became the student union's higher education vice president.  During this role I ran the collective college partnership’s  Student Union consisting of 5 colleges.  Towards the end of my role, every student was filling out the annual student survey. Every section for the student union had improved ten-fold. Most noticcably, the student union satisfaction rating went up from 30% to ~85%. 


    This role required me to be an effective leader and team player. I needed to communicate complex ideas to the board members within meetings. I had to learn to deal with fast paced deadlines and even how to interview and select an appropriate repalcement candiate. I believe all of these skills I have obtained will come in very useful within this job.

Remember earlier when I said it's all about spinning a story? Make sure to include statistics if you can. This section is ripe for you to spin, to make yourself sound amazing. At the time, my job required me to go to a meeting once a month and pop into classrooms to discuss student issues. That doesn't seem like much, but I can spin it to make it sound amazing. Also, the statistics help a lot.

When you end this, you have to make the interview aware that you have finished. With this question, sometimes there is a few awkward seconds of the interviwer wondering "did they finish?"

In my case, I like to end it with:

    If there is anything else you would like to know, feel free to ask me


Most candiates fail this question because they have not practiced. They do not know how to answer or what to talk about. This results in the candiate vomiting out positions and words until they are satisfied that they've covered the question.

Throughout all of these questions in this book, I urge you to practice them. It simply is not enough to read it and forget it, you need to write your own answer to these questions. This question especially. This question is asked in pretty much every interview, and normally right at the start of an interview. Because it's asked at the start, it counts towards your first impression. If you do not answer this question confidently then the interviwer will likely not hire you, even if you answer every other question well.

The interviewer asks this question because it allows them to get a rough idea of your background and experience. Sure, they could read your CV. But the interviewer sees this as an "easy" question and it helps to calm your nerves.

2. Why are you applying?

So this question is really “What can you do that we need you to do?”. They want to know what problems you can solve.
Make sure to reflect the job specification in this.
In the Reed book “why you” they say that this can be expressed in one sentence:


    I’m applying because my skills, experience, and motivation are the best fit for the job.


This has to be customised per job interview, so no blanket answers here.
Don’t say you:


    Need money


    You want to get out of the house


    A short commute is better than a long one


Act and believe that you want this job because you love it!
3. What are your greatest strengths?
Customise this question again. Reflect the job description within this question.
This is not the time to be humble, but do try to not sound arrogant.
An example of this answer could be something like:
“I’m  an extremely hard worker. I often don’t pick up many projects but when I  do I go all in. Recently I’ve picked up blogging, managing to amass  more than 8000 monthly readers in less than 5 months.”
Do use statistics. This is really important. Statistics lets you talk big about yourself without sounding too egoistical.
There’s  a difference between saying “God, if everyone who read my articles was  their own country it would be a small country. I must be an amazing  writer” and saying “I have 8000 monthly reads in 5 months”.
But  only say what’s relevant. If I was applying to a job at a students  union or anything to do with students I would say “I increased student  satisfaction and approval ratings from 30% to ~90%”.
You  don’t have to be given a statistic to use it. You can work it out  yourself. You know all these maths classes you took? Now is a good time  to use them. Do you deal with customers a lot and do always say you’re  doing well? Put that into a statistic.
Make  sure your strengths match the job description. If the employer asks for  good knowledge of Python (or German) talk about that.
You see this?
Do you remember this game? The idea is to get the shapes in the right holes.
Now,  you could have the best blocks. The best blocks in the USA, the best  blocks in the world. No one could ever have better blocks than you. But  as long as you’re trying to fit this amazing diamond cube into a  triangular hole, it’ll never ever work.
Well, unless you’re a mathematician:
The  same can be said for job interviews. Often it’s better to present  something that you’re only 60–80% good at that matches the job  description rather than talking about something you are absolutely  amazing at that doesn’t match the job description.
The  recruiter wants to find the right person for the job. They want to find  the right shape for the right hole. Make sure you mould yourself into  the shape they want.
4. What are your greatest weaknesses?
DO NOT USE weaknesses such as:


    I’m a hard worker


    I overwork so much


    I obsess with team work


Yeah  sure this may have worked 30–40 years ago but employers can see the  lies from miles away. Use an actual weakness but don’t say something  like:


    Sometimes I get really vivid thoughts of murdering people that interview me :)


Use  something that was a problem and talk about how you’ve overcome this.  If you’re still overcoming it say so. My example would be:


    “I  used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a  no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events  it was inevitable for me to phone people so I’ve gotten use to it. I’m  still overcoming this but I’m not as bad as I was a year or two ago.”


But  don’t make the weakness a part of the job description. If the job  description says “you ne ed to be really good at talking to people”  never say “I’m really bad at talking to someone”.
Make sure you say how you overcame your weakness and turn it into something positive. Make it into a mini story. 
Make sure  this won’t be a problem at your current company. Say something like “I  believe this won’t be a problem in this company” and then say why. Mine  would be:


    “I  used to be terrified of phone calls. The idea of phoning someone was a  no go for me. Having worked in a students union and at multiple events  it was inevitable for me to phone people so I’ve gotten use to it. I’m  still overcoming this but I’m not as bad as I was a year or two ago. I  believe this won’t be a problem at this company because I’m passionate  for the cause of this company which would allow me to talk more on the  phone to people revolving around this company. That’s one of the reasons  I want to join this company, because I get to do what I love and I get  to push my boundaries and get out of my comfort zone, to grow both  personally and professionally.”


Make  it very clear that this question is as normal as giving your name and  address, do not act like they are forcing information out of you like  you’re some sort of foreign intelligence agent.
Whatever you do, under all circumstances, NEVER ever EVER reply with any of these:


    I’m a perfectionist!


    I work too hard


    I don’t have any!


    Chocolate / food


5. What will your skills and ideas bring to this company?
This question is basically:


    Why should we care about you? What can you do that others can’t?


And this question, is one of the best questions possible.


    What can you do that others can’t?


They are literally asking you to mow down your competition. Do not show mercy, destroy them.
If you’ve worked on a preproject (mentioned in this article) this is the time to say so. Something like:


    I  saw your company used this Python package on GitHub but that Python  package is deprecated. I’ve actually made a Python package that works  the same but uses all the conventions that Python requires now. It’s  also a little bit faster.


You have to really customise this one per company. Play your A-game here.
Do not talk badly about other people, just focus on your strengths.
Normally you will want to focus on what you’re good at here. Talk about that.
If  you haven’t done a preproject, talk about what you’ve done in the past.  Specific measurable achievements and make it sound like you can do this  to this company.


    “I turned a failing product from 30 sales a month to 10,000 a week, I want to sell as many of Product X as possible”.


Or take this answer from The Balence


    I  will bring my unique vision to your company. I am experienced in the  many areas related to this company’s current goals, including expanding  international sales. For example, I helped improve international sales  at a previous company by over 25%. My sales background, along with my  ability to plan ahead, will help facilitate that growth.


6. What’s your preferred management style?
This question is just the interviewer wanting to know if you are going to get along together.
There’s 3 main steps to this question.


    Define what good management is


They  obviously care about good management, so it’s important that you and  the interviewer get on the same page about what good management is.  Here’s an answer from The Muse


    Management  style is so hard to put your finger on, but I think in general a good  manager gives clear directions and actually stays pretty hands-off, but  is ready and available to jump in to offer guidance, expertise, and help  when needed. I try my best to make that my management style.


2. Add your on take
Now  say something that makes you unique. You want to stand out, not appear  to be another sheep in the candiate pool. Here’s a good response for the  second part from Forbes


    “In  terms of what makes me unique, I also go out of my way to make sure I  know when my team needs help. I don’t hang around and wait to be called  upon by my direct reports — I go to them. That means plenty of informal  check-ins, both on the work they’re doing and on their general job  satisfaction and mental well-being.”


3. Add an example
Examples always work in interview answers. Back up what you’ve said. Here’s an answer to this part, again from The Muse


    I  remember one project in particular at my most recent position where I  supervised seven staff that involved everyone working on a separate  aspect of the product. This meant a lot of independent work for my team,  but rather than bog everyone down with repetitive meetings to update me  and everyone else on progress made, I created a project wiki that  allowed us to communicate new information when necessary without  disrupting another team member’s work. I then made it my job to make  sure no one was ever stuck on a problem too long without a sounding  board.


7. Where do you see yourself in five years’ time?
This  question is the employer wanting to know if you plan to work there for a  long time. Every employer wants to know you’ll work there for a long  time, even if it’s just a waitering job.
Say something along the lines of:


    I  don’t know your company well enough, but I would like to think I would  still be working here. In 5 years time I would have liked to learnt  enough to be able to train people in future roles.


Here’s a sample answer video:
I actually prefer Linda Raynier’s video on this:
She has many good examples of interview questions and how to answer them.
Learning  is a multi step process, you can’t just read something and expect to be  an expert in it. You have to practice for yourself and see what works  for you and customise it per job.
8. How would you approach this job?
This  question is a bit weird.. It’s kind of a trap. Because you will never  completely know how a company works without working at that company,  don’t answer like you’re an expert on this but you do need to answer  like you have a relatively good idea of what you’re doing.
An answer like this could work:


    Well,  the best way to do this job won’t come clear to me until I start this  job. But I’ll start by getting to know my colleauges and team,  listening, taking notes, building relationships, and helping people out  where I can. After all that, I’ll have a good idea of how to do this job  in the best way possible. At my last job I did…


Notice the example again. Talk about how you best undertook your last job but don’t go on and on forever.
9. What have you achieved in other roles?
This is the question which gives you permission to not be humbled. Talk about what ever you’re proudest of. Mine would be:


    My  role as Higher Education Vice President started off on a bad turn.  There were supposed to be 5 student union officers, but only I wanted to  do the job. Effectively leaving me in charge of the work of 5 people,  all whilst the student union staff who work with us had left to go to  another job.


    Luckily  this was perfect for me, as I stepped up when no one else would. I  travelled to every campus as much as possible to make sure all students  were listened to. When a group of students came to me telling me that  their course isn’t being properly funded I demanded a meeting with the  principle of East Kent College to fix this.


    As  well as this I repeatedly represented the students in a democratic way  at both a local (Kent) way and in a national way. I was chosen to attend  the National Union of Student’s National Conference, where I elected  the next NUS officer team and chose to represent my college on a  national scale.


    By  the end of the year the students were asked to fill out a survey about  their time at college. Student union approval ratings were previously  laying around 30%, with about 5 questions about the student’s union. By  the time I finished, it laid around 90% with comments from students  saying about how amazing it was for their problems to be fixed so  easily.


    On  top of this, I received a letter from the Chief Executive President of  Student Welfare saying that I was the best Student Union’s Officer ever  and rewarding me with a £50 Amazon voucher.


Notice how I’m tooting my own horn here, this question allows you to do that.
Talk about your achievements, talk about the statistics that back these achievements up. But make sure it’s in a story, humans really like stories.
10. What did you like and dislike about your last job?
On one hand, you don’t want to sound like a moaner who hated your last job but you also want to appear authentic.
The  interviewer is inviting you to say something negative about your last  job, because everyone doesn’t like something about their job.
Since  it’s easy to talk about what you like most of your last job, this part  will focus on mainly how to talk about the negatives.
Don’t discuss people, discuss circumstances or tasks.
Here’s a good answer from here


    I  must say that I loved many things about my previous job: amazing people  and an environment where I was challenged at every turn. However- there  was one thing I didn’t like: expectations sometimes were unclear. I  would be assigned a project with loose guidelines and turn it in on time  to specifications. I’d then be told I did the project wrong. I’ve since  learned to communicate better- to ask my supervisor if I have  questions- and I’ve learned to never assume. Two people can look at  project guidelines and draw vastly different interpretations of what is  to be done. I’ll always be thankful for that learning experience and for  the great folks at the company.


11. Tell me about a time you worked in a team
You’re very likely going to work in a team, so the interviewer wants to know how good you are at team work.
Talk about an experience you’ve had within a team, what you did, how well your team did. Use the STAR method here.
This is really personal and customised to you, so no examples from me here. You should really form your own answers.
This is a really good video on this question:
12. What do your coworkers say about you?
Bring  along testimonials. Reference letters. Show them when this question is  asked. Show LinkedIn testimonials, on your personal website,  testimonials on paper. Never just pull out your phone or any items  without asking if it’s okay by them to take out your testimonials.
Here’s a good answer that doesn’t refer to a testimonial from The Balence


    My  colleagues have told me that I am extremely organized and excellent at  time management. During one project, my team members praised me for  developing and sticking to a timeline for all the phases of the project.  (Give a brief summary of what the project was.) We ended up  successfully completing it ahead of time, and it was a hit


13. How do you deal with stress and failure?
Don’t  pretend like you’ve never experienced stress. Talk about how you deal  with stress and failure. This is highly personal so again customise this  to you. My answer would be:


    I  once was rejected by 5 universties. I had no idea what I would be doing  come September. This was a highly stressful time for me because I  expected to get into at least one university. I went running, I took a  few days off work and I decided on my options. I could either of been  sad, moany and upset for the rest of that month or I could of manned up,  accecpted what had happened and decided on my next step. I chose the  latter.


I quite like this video from Siraj on the topic offailure:
14. How much money do you want?
Quincy Larson has a good article on this here:
Salary Negotiation: how not to set a bunch of money on fire Pop quiz, hot shot.medium.freecodecamp.org
If the salary is given in the job description, don’t try to negoiate it.
Questions  on salary are difficult. Once you give a number, you lose. They know  that’s your maximum, so don’t try and be the first one to give a number.  The interviewer might ask:
“What’s your current salary?”
Which is just a trick to find out how much money you’re okay with.
You should avoid these questions, don’t give them any numbers. If they ask one of these simply say:


    I’m not comfortable sharing that information at this point


Here’s a good quote relating to this subject:


    At  some point in the process you achieve something which I describe as  “Yes, if…” rather than “No, but…”. “Yes, we want to work with you, if we  can come to a mutually satisfactory offer,” which is distinguished  from, “No, we don’t want to work with you, but we might work with you if  it turns out that you’re disgustingly cheap.” After you have agreement  in principle that, “We want you to work here. What’ll it take to make  that happen?” — then and only then do you start talking about  money. — Patrick McKenzie


Quincy  suggests that switching this salary neogiation over to email is good.  You have time to think about what’s being said and time to reply. You  also have concrete proof of a salary in the emails.
Once the employer asks something like “but we have to negoiate salary at some point” just say “can you email me at all?”.
It  never hurts to negoiate, statistics show that 87% of companies won’t  pull a job offer if a candiate neogiates their salary (Why You? — James  Reed).
You  need to prepare for this question. You need to research what other  employees are earning at this company, what people with the same job  title but at different companies are earning. You can use Google,  Glassdoor, Payscale to find this information. The location of the job  matters too and will effect salary.
Have  3 numbers in your head. The perfect amount which is the highest amount  possible for this job. The lowest amount, at which point you may as well  walk away from the job offer and the medium amount, which is the middle  of the 2.
If  the company offers you stock options, don’t play around with that.  Nothing beats cold hard salary. It’s very unlikely the company you work  at is going to be the next Facebook. In some cases stock options are  worth more than cash but normally this is not true.
When  you get to the point of emailing the employer, ask “what do you think  I’m wroth?” or “How much were you thinking?”. The first person to give a  solid number loses. You know how in Pawn Stars they always haggle down?  That’s because the seller always gives the price first. They know  that’s their maximum, so they try to save themselves money.
Once you give a number the employer will do exactly the same. They’ll haggle down.
If  your maximum salary number is £100k, and they offer you £100k I  wouldn’t try to bargain. Unless you’re absolutely amazing, some kind of  super human who’s absolutely worth more than the maximum salary in the  industry I wouldn’t do it. But then again, 87% of companies won’t pull a  job offer because of negoiation so you can try anyway.
However  in the real world this probably isn’t going to happen. They’ll likely  offer you £50k or half of your highest maximum salary number. This is  where you can haggle up. They’re allowed to haggle you down, so why  don’t you haggle up?
Here’s a story of a guy who negoiated and got a compenstation package worth £250k.

In busines school you learn to pit sellers against each other.
“Yes,  I really love this car but this store down the road is offering it to  me 10% cheaper. I really like this store, is there anyway you can offer  it to me cheaper?”

15. Show me your creativity
This question can come out in many forms, but they all reference creativity.
Almost all employers look for creativity.
Creativity does not have to be you painting a picture or creating a sculpture.
You might decide to create a Google Sheets document so everyone on your course knows all the deadline dates for course work.
As  with all interview questions it’s important to provide examples here  and I can’t tell you what examples to include as I don’t know you.
Here’s a good answer from here:


    While  working at SalesCompany, I developed a lead generalization email that  generated an unheard of 37% response rate — well above the previous  record of 12%, using a friendly tone that made the email prepare casual  and personally written, despite being a template.


Change “uhhhh” to “ “

Instead of saying “uhhhh” and “ehhhhhh” just pause. Smile.


Ask for a pause

In  Karate we have something called a Kata, which is like a dance of all  the moves you’re supposed to know at your level. It’s perfectly okay  that between moves you take a  short pause, a little break to think about what your next move is but  when you perform the next move you do it strongly and fast.
The same can be said for interviews. It’s perfectly okay to say


    Sorry, I’m feeling a little nervous. Do you mind if I have a few seconds to myself so I can calm down?


The  interviewer knows your nervous. The difference here is that you’ve  recognised this and you’ve done something to try to mitigate it. Most  people who are interviewed are nervous and they never stop being  nervous. They just talk and talk and talk and rush through everything.
In  Karate if you rushed through your Kata it would be extremely ugly and  convoluted. The same holds for interviews. Do not rush through  questions. Don’t even worry about a time limit. If you’re calm and  careful the interviewer will keep track of time.
