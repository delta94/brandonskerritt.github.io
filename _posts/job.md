# Why do I want this job?

I've been interested in working for this company ever since I was a child. I've always loved code breaking and problem solving, having read Simon Singh's The Code Book as a child. Ever since I found out that I could get a job in problem solving I've been ecstatic and working hard to achieve this.

# What are my strengths?

I think my biggest strength is my problem solving abillity. I can look at problems from different perspectives and really break down what a problem essentially is and in some cases I can repharse what a problem is which helps. This is very benefical in programming or cryptography where you essentially solve problems 90% of the time.


# What are my weaknesses?
Include an actual real weakness and how you work to overcome it

In the past I have had problems with answering emails in a timely fashion. I'm starting to overcome this by putting aside a time slot everyday in the morning to check my emails.

# What do I have to offer?

Knowledge Based Skills | Transferable Skills | Personal trait
--- | --- | ---


first column - list everything you've learnt
column 2 - less tangible but still desirable skills
Column 3 - list things instrincic to my personality

Once you select the essential things, prove them. Prove you have this skill etc.

# Behavioral questions

Common questions | project 1 | project 2 | project 3
--- | --- | --- | ---
challenges | A facebook chatbot I created was working perfectly fine locally but when uploaded to Heroku it breaks. I found out that Facebook limits how many messages a bot can send to a user, so I had to change the content of the message. | I was working on SkyBets API at a hackathon and the API wasn't made so you could get details of bets (only place them) so I had to parse the HTML using beautiful soup and requests in Python to create my own sort-of API for this | At another hackathon we created a Capital One app for Alexa and I worked on the capital one API. I made cool features like a financial summary which was hard to do because there was so much data.
mistakes / failures | I wanted to make a decryption tool (like cyberchef but before it existed to the public) that took an input, decrypted it automatically and returned the decryption but this was far too advance for my level of programming at the time. I still tried as hard as I could and it worked really well but the project was really hard to keep up with the code being so messy |

# What questions should you ask the interviewer?

3 types of questions

## Genuine questions
Questions you actually want to know the answer to
What brought you to this company?
Is the company like a family
etc etc

## Insightful Questions
These questions demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of a technology

I noticed that you used technology X, how do you handle problem Y?
Why did the product choose to use X procotol instead of Y protocol? I know it has advantages A,B ,C  but many companies choose not to use it because of problem D

## Passion questions
Designed to demonstrate your passion for technology

I'm very interetsed in cryptography and i'd love to learn more about it. What opportunities are there at this company?

# Responding to behavioral questions

Be specific not arrogant
Instead of saying you did all the hard parts say what parts you found hard

Limit details
Your interviewer may get confused, limit details and say "I can explain how i solved this problem if you want"

# Questions

## Tell me about yourself


I'm a computer science student at the university of liverpool aiming to get a first class degree, previously studying computing at a local college.

While at college I became the student union's higher education vice president. During this role I improved the collective college partnership consisting of 5 colleges. Towards the end of my role the annual student survey was completed and every section for the student union, most noticably the student union satisfaction and representation area went up by 50% to around 85%. The skills I learnt was to be an effecticve team player, to communicate complicated ideas to board members in meetings, interviewing skills and how to deal with deadlines which i believe will help me in this position during work.
