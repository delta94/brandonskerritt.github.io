Success isn't esoteric

I only count my situps when they hurt

And when my prayers to god were met with indifference I picked up a pen I wrote my own deliverance

The two most important days of your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.

Somebody once told me the definition of hell:
On your last day on earth, the person you became will meet the person you could have become.


You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something. Your gut, destiny life.
Karma, whatever. Because believing the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even if it leads you down the unworn path. You have to find what you love. Even if you haven't found it yet, keep looking. And don't settle. As with all matters of the heart you'll know when you find it. Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Never, never, never give up.

You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life

Even if you run slowly you're still lapping everyone who sits on the sofa.

When you want to succeed as bad as you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful

What gets measured gets improved
