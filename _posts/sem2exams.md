Hey! Exam season is coming up. Here's some of the best resources to help you reach that first class degree!  
Some people question why I do this. Well, firstly I'm dumb as fuck. I have no GCSEs or A levels. So this is just a much a plan for me as it is for you. I earn **no money** from this. I just want to see everyone do their best!!

Here's an exam time table courtsey by one of your other course reps, Huba

Algorithms

Here is every single class test, every single question Pruduence has asked us + general knowledge and flashcards you need to know:

To test yourself, click "test" to generate a practice test. Quizlet requires an account but if you want flashcards tailored for this course then it's good. The flashcards can be done backwards too, so you get the answer and you have to figure out what the question is referencing. 

Big O notation is a big part of this module. Every lecture she's presented us with a program and asked us what the psuedocode is. So you can guess that this will come up in the exam. For that reason, I've written a seperate blog post here:

Of course I have these qustions in my quizlet for this module.

Here's every single thing we've done in this module:

Here's a blog post on Linked Lists (featuring blockchain)

Insertion sort and selection sort are the same

Paul - comp116 - Mathematics

So Paul's module is... interesting. His tutorials aren't so useful for exams (as they don't exactly match the exam content) so I'm going to list a lot of resources here.

Paul's module is broken down into

- Vectors & Matrices
- Calculus
- Complex Numbers
- Statistics
- *Returns back to matrices*
- Information Theory (which I am not sure whether he will cover, so best to see what he says about this one)

You can therefore group these into 4 main topics: Vectors & Matrices, Calculus, Complex Numbers and Statistics. Matrices and Vectors is called Linear Algebra.

Let's go through and provide resources for every single one:

Numbers

Although this is relatively easy, here's a blog post on it:

Polynomials

Linear Algebra

3blue1brown's videos are really good for getting an intution at how linear algebra actually works:

Vectors, a short guide

Linear Algebra, a blog post by me

Calculus:

Here's a good 3blue1brown series on it

Complex Numbers

https://brandonskerritt.github.io/university/complex-numbers/

I quite like this video series on complex numbers too:

Statistics

Paul's tutorials

Here is the repo I use for his tutorials:

Quizlet

Paul's pre-class test answered

David Jackson - Computer Systems

Dave's module seems to be less about memorising things and more about knowing facts and how things work and answering edge case questions based on these facts. So memorisation plays a key part here but so does knowing how things work.

This is a quizlet featuring some questions he's asked in lectures + other things
